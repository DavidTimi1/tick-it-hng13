# Tick-it: Streamlined Ticket Management

## Overview

Tick-it is a modern, responsive single-page application built with Vue.js for efficient ticket creation, tracking, and management. It leverages Pinia for robust state management, Vue Router for seamless navigation, and Tailwind CSS for a sleek, utility-first design, providing a smooth user experience.

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: A personalized dashboard displaying a summary of all tickets, categorized by status (Open, In Progress, Closed).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Client-Side Persistence**: User and ticket data are persisted locally using `localStorage`.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all forms to enhance user input quality.
